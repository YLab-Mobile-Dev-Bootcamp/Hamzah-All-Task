In the Second session of Ylabs Developer Bootcamp, I was told to make a Flutter app consisting at minimum of 4 widgets.
I made a realtime Weather App for my city, Bogor. This is my very first ever mobile application I made using Flutter.

The Widgets I use are listed below:
- Scaffold
- Collumn
- Padding
- Text
- Expanded
- ListView
- ListTile

And above all tasks given for us, I also learn about open source API fetching for the realtime weather information.
