In the Second session of Ylabs Developer Bootcamp, I was told to make a Flutter app consisting at minimum of 4 widgets.
I made a realtime Weather App for my city, Bogor. This is my very first ever mobile application I made using Flutter.

The Widgets I use are listed below:
- Scaffold
- Collumn
- Padding
- Text
- Expanded
- ListView
- ListTile

And above all tasks given for us, I also learn about open source API fetching using Flutter for the realtime weather information.

Update third session, I'm using GetX for navigation and state management. And for fourth session, I have already implement API fetching in the second session task :), but I'll try to use another form of API fetching, prolly finished on 18 aug 21. Thankss
